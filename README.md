# iEgypt

iEgypt is an online platform that acts as a digital societyto represent Egypt in all of its’ beautiful colors. Egypt has many talented citizens that would share their great work. Through this platform, content providers like photographers, writers, designers ...etc. can share their pieces of art that reflects Egypt. All of the submitted work has to follow some guidelines so
that it will help in creating an identity for Egypt. Organizations such as companies, agencies, schools...etc. can request to use those designs in their projects.

## Project Specifications

Users have profiles on the system that display their information: full name (first name, middle name and last name), personal email and age. Users are categorized into three types: viewers, contributors and staff members. Staff members are either authorized reviewer or content manager.

Contributors like graphic designers, photographers, video editors, directors, music producers ... etc., can share their work or designs that is described as content by posting them on the website. Contributors are able to insert a link of their portfolio on their profile and their years of experience. The content is categorized into original content or new content (As it will be further explained in a coming section). The content has different type such as: images, logos, videos, stickers, banners, sound tracks, presentation templates...etc. The original content can be bought by the viewers by putting in a request.
On the other hand, viewers have a name of their working place, it’s description and it’s type: companies, organizations, schools, universities, governmental sectors...etc.

Viewers are able to view the Contributor’s content. Every content belongs to a certain subcategory (It will be further explained in a coming section). Contents are listed differently from each other according to their category.

## Events

If a viewer has a coming event, he/she can share information about that event. After an event is shared an announcement is made. All information about an event is important as: link containing photos of the place , description of both the event and the organization, location, city, time of the event and entertainer.

## Requests

The viewer can put in a request. Requests are either new request or existing request. A Viewer can apply for a new request if he/she wants to ask for a new content or apply for an existing request, requesting an original content. We need to keep track of the viewer who applied for a request. The system keeps track of the viewer that applied for a request. New request is made by the viewer if they want to have a new design/logo created for them. New Request should have information about the new content. The new request should ask the viewer if they want a certain contributor to create their design or not. If they have
a certain contributor in mind, the viewer can specify in his/her request the contributor. New requests can be accepted or rejected by the contributor. The system should keep track of the contributors that accepted or rejected a request. If a new request is rejected the viewer won’t be able to reapply on it. As for the existing requests, they are applied for when a viewer wants to buy an original content having a review of 4 or 5 stars. (As it will be further discussed in the coming section.)

## Content uploading cycle

The content provided by the contributors can be classified into original content and new content. Once the content is uploaded on the system, it will have a unique serial number. We need to keep track of the contributor who uploaded it, date of uploading the content, rating, type and a link containing the content.

Before the original content is uploaded on the system it must first pass by the staff members. The authorized reviewer will filter all the original content. The approved content by the authorized reviewer, will be further filtered by the content manager. The system should keep track of the staff members that reviewed the content and their responses. The content manager should be classified into different types. Each content manager should filter the content according to his/her type. (e.g. If the content is logo then it should only be filtered by the content manager responsible for the logos). The original content is the approved content by the content manager as it will be the only content visible to the viewer. On the other hand, when the contributor is done with creating the requested design it will be uploaded in the new content.
After the original content is uploaded on the system it can be reviewed by the viewers. We need to keep track of the user who reviewed the content, his/her comment and rating. Once the content has a rate of 4 or 5 stars, it can be bought by a viewer, by applying an existing request on it. The system should keep track of the requested content as well as the viewer who requested them.

## Category

We need to promote Egypt from different perspectives by displaying information in different categories. We need to keep our system as general as possible such that we can always add new categories. Each category has a type (e.g. Educational, Investment, Tourism...etc) that identifies it, and a description. Each category can have many subcategories related to it. Subcategories have a name and are identified by their corresponding category. Based on the type of the content uploaded by the contributor, it will be subcategorized in the category. (e.g. A category can be Education having subcategories like high school and higher education.)

## Messages

Messages can be sent back and forth between a viewer and a contributor. Messages should be saved along with the date of the message. After a contributor is done with creating the requested design he/she can message the viewer who requested the design. The system should keep track of both the sender and receiver.

## Announcements

The system should notify the users and the staff members by creating an announcement. An announcement should notify the contributors that a Viewer made a new request. As well as when a viewer creates a new Event the system should notify both the Contributors and the staff members.

## Advertisements

Advertisements are auto generated when a viewer applies for one, whether the viewer has an event or just for publicity by providing information of an organization or an event as: description, location, photos, videos and place. Ads will use all the information provided to generate a website to deliver the needed information for the public.
